MongoDB Playground


## Getting started

### Requirements
- Docker
- Docker compose

### The project
To start the project you will need to enter the following command in the root of the project: <br> `docker-compose up` <br>
This will start a MongoDB database, a mongoimport process to seed the db and a Jupyter Lab with all the dependencies you need to start working with your project, everything is already setup for you.
Whenever you want to bring down the containers don't forget to `docker-compose down`.
